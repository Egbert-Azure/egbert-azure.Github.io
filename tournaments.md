Welcome to my world of competitive chess! In this section, you will find updates and results from various chess tournaments I have participated in. Currently, you can explore my journey in the **Electronic Knights Semi-Finals** tournament, where I compete against skilled opponents in two exciting sections, **21ENs03** and **21ENs04**.
