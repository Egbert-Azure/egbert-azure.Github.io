## Puzzle of the Week

The knight on the rim has a notoriously bad reputation with the saying "A knight on the rim is grim." On the other hand, edge knights have decided World Championship matches, such as Bobby Fischer's surprising Nf6-h5 in the "Match of the Century" against Boris Spassky in 1972. Magnus Carlsen also occasionally employs the "edge knight system" 1.e4 g6 2.d4 Nf6 3.e5 Nh5.

In German language it's *Randspringer* and *Randspringer* was the self published Magazine of Rainer Schlenker. Rainer used in this week puzzle a sacrifice combination to win very quickly as Black, despite being down a queen. Find the combination.

In case you need it, **Fritz** is giving you hints.
