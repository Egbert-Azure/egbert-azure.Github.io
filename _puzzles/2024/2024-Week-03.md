## Puzzle of the Week

August Julius Mendheim (c. 1781 – † 25 August 1836) was a German chess player and composer. He is considered the first Prussian chess master and forerunner of the Berlin Chess School.
The interesting position is two folded: White can mate in five if White to move and so can Black.
