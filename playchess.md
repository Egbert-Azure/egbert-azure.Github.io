Players can play in this room, they can play tournaments and it is possible to give online-training or play a simul. 

Players can enter the room as guest but then you cannot chat and no one will recognize you because you only have a number which, moreover, changes at each visit. Therfore, a free of charge [ChessBase Account](https://account.chessbase.com/en) to enter the room is recommended.
