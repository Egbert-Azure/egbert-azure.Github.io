In the Electronic Knights Semi-Final, section 21ENs03 I was again paired with Herb Wolfe, whom I had the plessure to play multiple times.

With Black I decided to go with the Pirc after he opened with e4. It ends up in a B08 Pirc Classical System and after move 10. I was behind my development, but managed to come back, having a perfect middle game.
