I wrongfully noted move 18 on April 28th. Douglas informed me on July 28th about the situation.
Other then sending move reminder I never heard back from Douglas including reporting the game result.

I resigned from the game to maintain my fair play and sportsmanship principles.

## My mail to my opponent:

*Dear Douglas,*
*Thank you for getting back to me. I understand that we have differing views on how to handle this situation.*
*As a player, open communication, respect for the rules, and sportsmanship are crucial aspects of correspondence chess. When I notice an error in my opponent's recording, I immediately communicate with my opponent and rectify the mistake promptly. This situation happened three times in this "Electronic Knights" tournament section. My opponents highly appreciated this.*
*Given the impact of the recorded error on move 18, I would like to propose two potential paths to address this matter fairly:
Option A: Consider the game a draw. Since the recording error on move 18 had significant consequences, this decision would uphold the integrity of the game.*
*Option B: Replay the game from Move 18. We can ensure a fair contest without any unintended advantages or disadvantages by starting over.
I understand you have declined the draw offer previously, but I really hope you reconsider, as it would be a fair solution. Alternatively, we could consult the arbiter and wait for the decision on how best to proceed.*
*However, if you decide not to consider either option, I will have to express my regrets, but I cannot continue the game under the current circumstances. I will resign from the game to maintain my fair play and sportsmanship principles.*

*Regardless of the outcome, we might meet again in a future tournament. After all, we are all swimming in the same fishbowl of the chess community, and this shared passion connects us all.*

*I hope we find a solution that upholds the spirit of correspondence chess and fosters mutual respect among players.*

*Amici Sumus,*

*Egbert*
