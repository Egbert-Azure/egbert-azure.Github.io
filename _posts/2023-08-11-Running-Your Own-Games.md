## Running Your Own Games and Tournaments Online

Are you looking to host your private chess tournaments, create a playing room for your chess club, school, or company, and enjoy the excitement of online chess? It's easier than you think! You can set up your private chess server and completely control your virtual chess environment with a few simple steps. No technical skills are required! Here's how to get started:

**1. Set Up Your Playing Room**

You only need a web browser to create your playing room on PlayChess.com. Follow these steps:

- In your browser's address bar, enter the following URL: `https://play.chessbase.com?room=`
- Add the desired name for your playing room after the equals sign. For instance, if you want to name your room "XY-City," your complete address will be: `https://play.chessbase.com?room=XY-City`
- Press Enter, and you're instantly on your chess server!

**2. Enjoy Complete Control**

Once you're in your virtual playing room, you have the freedom to:

- Play chess games with your friends, colleagues, or guests.
- Provide chess training and lessons within your private environment.
- Organize tournaments, simuls, and chess events exclusively for your group.
- Customize the name of your room and share its address only with those you invite.

**3. Your Chess Sanctuary**

Creating your chess environment ensures a private and tailored experience. Your playing room becomes a place where you and your chosen participants can immerse yourselves in chess without distractions. Whether you're a chess club looking to hold internal tournaments, a school offering online chess lessons, or a group of friends seeking a dedicated chess space, this setup is ideal.
