## Introduction

As a chess enthusiast, I recently found myself drawn back to an old favorite: the 150 Attack. Watching the Serbian Women Chess Championship, I was captivated by WFM Vera Vujovic's strategic prowess in employing this often overlooked opening. So I thought it's worth to share a couple of insights and opening strategy thinking.

## Exploring the 150 Attack vs Pirc and Modern Defense

The position showcased below, from Vujovic's game in round 7, epitomizes the essence of the 150 Attack against Black's Modern Defense:

## 150 Attack

I would categorize this as the **150 Attack**, which is is a powerful system against the **Pirc** and **Modern Defenses**, favored by GMs such as **Vishy Anand** and **Michael Adams**. As White, you build up with pawns on **e4** and **d4**, knights on **c3** and **f3**, with **5.Be3** and **6.Qd2** to follow or you move your white square bishop to d3 and then Qd2. You can play the 150 Attack against all Modern and Pirc move orders. This aggressive setup aims to prevent Black from achieving their usual setup with **g6**, **Bg7**, and **e5** or **c5**, while giving White a straightforward kingside onslaught with **f3**, **g4**, **h4**, **h5**, and **Bh6**.

In response to Black's hypermodern setup, White has several options at their disposal:

- Seizing control of the center with early d4, restricting Black's counterplay.
- Developing the dark-squared bishop to b5 or c4 to pressure Black's knight on c6 and dominate the d5 square.
- Delaying Nc3 to maintain flexibility, possibly opting for the Austrian Attack with f4.
- Launching a kingside assault with moves like g4 and h4-h5 to exploit Black's exposed king.
- Exploiting Black's early queenside pawn moves with ideas like a4-a5.

Overall, accurate opening play as white requires understanding of key strategic and tactical ideas against the Modern Defense. Control of the center and rapid development are essential to punish black's hypermodern setup. The Two Knights Variation lines require precision as the position quickly becomes very sharp.

I played as White exactly the position Vera Vujovic played in round 7.

## Personal Reflections and Recommendations

As I revisited this opening after the first time ever since my return from the 25yr hiatus, I was reminded of its complexities and challenges. Despite previous setbacks, I find myself intrigued by the strategic depth offered by the weapon against the Pirc and Modern Defense.

Currently, I'm delving into Viktor Moskalenko's **The Perfect Pirc-Modern - 10 Years Later,** a valuable resource for understanding the nuances of this opening. Alongside my own exploration, I encourage fellow enthusiasts to join me in studying and mastering the intricacies of the Pirc and Modern Defense.

## Analyzing Games

Let's take a closer look at two intriguing games featuring the same position for White:

**Game 1:** van der Hoeven's Approach
Van der Hoeven opted for a strategic approach, delaying Qd2 in favor of a timely a4, demonstrating the versatility of White's position.

**Game 2:** A Dynamic Encounter
This game showcases dynamic play from both sides, highlighting the tactical intricacies inherent in the Modern Defense.

van der Hoeven hold back with Qd2 and castled first, then pushed a4, which is quite interesting!

Coincidantly when I wrote this blog Chessbase posted a blog on their [website](https://en.chessbase.com/post/the-modern-defense-and-its-ideas). It's a great read and I highly recommend it even when I don't agree to their assesment, but hey, the GMs are always right!

## Conclusion

As I traveled back in time to the roots of my chess openings, which I abondend, let's embrace the challenges and intricacies offered by such refreshed views. Your repertoire is your signature in chess. It reflects how you play. And whether you're a seasoned player or a novice enthusiast, there's always something new to discover in the vast realm of chess.
