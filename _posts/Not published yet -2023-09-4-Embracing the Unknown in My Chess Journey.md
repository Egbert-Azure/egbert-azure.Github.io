In my previous post, ["The Road to ELO 2000 - Unlearning and Rediscovering Openings"](https://egbert-azure.github.io/the-road-to-elo-2000/), I started the journey of unlearning and rediscovering openings in order to elevate my chess game. And not a big surprise, it's all about building a new repertoire that fits to your personal style.

## Embracing the Unknown

Now, let's take a closer look at the potential new black repertoire in response to the most common openings for white: e4 or d4. The thought process and insights from my lost games led me to find openings that align with my style of play while offering flexibility and transposotion to get a postion familiar with. For e4, I settled on the Pirc Defense—a choice that might not be frequently seen at the GM level but was even favored by the legendary Bobby Fischer in the "Match of the Century." The Pirc is the King’s Indian Defense without White’s pawn on c4. Plans and ideas are very similar, and it is easier for you to learn one defense if you already know the other one.

## Reflecting on the Path Traveled

Reflecting on my journey toward surpassing the ELO 2000 barrier, I am reminded of the valuable lessons I've gathered. The process of shedding deeply ingrained opening patterns was both challenging and profoundly rewarding. It provided me with a fresh perspective, free from the constraints of routine moves. The Reti, London System, King's Indian, and Pirc openings became my canvas, and with determination, I charted a new course.

Also, the Modern defense, the Philidor, the King’s Indian Attack, and the Reti are like brothers of the Pirc.

## The Creative Adaptation

This blog isn't a comprehensive opening strategy guide — I'm neither a grandmaster nor a coach. However, I hope my approach can offer insights to help you elevate your own game. The fundamental idea in response to white's e4 and black's Pirc Defense can be summarized as follows:

<img src="image-4.png" alt="White" width="50%">

And black's response

<img src="image-4.png" alt="Black" width=50%>

That's the main line and main idea. And it comes with some risks for sure. Giving up the center in a first approach one need carefully develop the pieces.

This approach has not only enriched my strategic toolkit but has also injected an element of unpredictability into my games. For a detailed breakdown of this strategy, I recommend checking out the ChessBase YouTube show "Svitlana's Smart Moves" where the concept is explained alongside iconic games like Kasparov vs. Topalov and Fischer vs. Spassky.

Svitlana's Smart Moves - The Pirc Defence

## Building a Repertoire for Black

Here an example to showcase. White's response is called the "Austrian Attack - I. A. 6. e5 Nfd7

For my repertoire I entered all variations like the above into the pgn, analyzed and added the line to my repertoire database.

- Austrian Attack - I. A. 6. e5 Nfd7
- Austrian Attack - I. B. 6. Be2 c5!
- Austrian Attack - I. C. 6. Bd3 Nc6!
- Austrian Attack - I. D. Be3 Nc6
- Austrian Miscellaneous Systems - II. 5. Bf4 Bg7
- King's Indian: Sämisch: 6th move deviations incl. 6.Be3
- Pirc Defence: Classical System - IV. 5. Be2 0-0

ChessBase will save your game with the variations which are already stored in the repertoire database. If the game is very similar to an existing repertoire game, ChessBase will suggest merging the two games in the repertoire database. You can let it do so or overrule it and save the game as a separate entry. If your game contains a completely new line the program will save it as a new game. It will even suggest a suitable name for it (e.g. "Pirc Austrian Attack").

If no repertoire database exists, ChessBase will automatically create one and add an icon to your database window.

While working on my repertoire, I had a good laugh when I came across the following statement on the chess.com website:

> The Pirc Defense is relatively new and not as heavy on theory as other classical openings.

Dear chess.com, do your homework! This opening was already utilized in the 18th century. Back then, such a style of play was considered unconventional. It wasn't until the late 1930s that it started gaining more attention. In the former USSR, it was Ufimtsev who explored it, and in the then Yugoslavia, it was Grandmaster Pirc. The opening gained popularity during the 1960s.


You can then take it from there and do your repoertoire training showcased in this youtube video:

While embracing the unknown has its rewards, it's not without its challenges. There were moments of uncertainty and setbacks, where a move I had not encountered before left me pondering for minutes. However, these challenges are integral to growth. Every encounter with the unfamiliar is an opportunity to learn, adapt, and improve. And with time, I found myself becoming more confident in navigating unexplored openings. I also modfied the standard path and adjusted based on learnings. You might want to check out such a game in my last week blog [Amici Sumus: Finding Unity and Strength in Chess - My Journey at the Peace Open Tournament](https://egbert-azure.github.io/Peace-Open-Amici-sumus/). Roberto Pinos Rubio's feedback was golden and spot on.

## Looking Ahead

My chess journey is far from over. The pursuit of improvement is a lifelong endeavor, and with each milestone reached, new horizons open up. As I continue to evolve as a player, I'm excited to dive even deeper into the uncharted waters of chess openings, strategies, and tactics. The road ahead is filled with opportunities for growth, and I'm excited to learn more and improve.

Thank you to everyone who has been a part of my journey so far. Your support, feedback, and camaraderie mean the world to me. 

Stay tuned for more updates, analyses, and insights as I venture further into the world of chess. Until then, may your games be filled with inspiration and your moves with purpose.

Keep evolving, keep playing, and keep discovering.
