Dear ICCF Board Members,

I am writing to express my profound concern regarding the participation of Russian chess players, particularly Team(s) Volga-Moscow-1 to 5, in the upcoming Champions League tournament scheduled to commence on February 25th, coinciding with the tragic anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has led to unimaginable suffering, including a humanitarian catastrophe with significant loss of life and widespread displacement.

What further exacerbates my concern is the sponsorship of the event by Chessify. While I appreciate Chessify's support for the Championâ€™s League with an award package worth $5000 in Chessify packages and coins, I am deeply troubled by the potential implications of this sponsorship. It is disheartening to contemplate an award package going to Russia and a team named Volga-Moscow associated with the event, especially when the participation of Russian players contradicts the principles of peace, freedom, and human rights that the ICCF aims to uphold.

While I commend the ICCF for its efforts, such as organizing the Peace Open tournament to express solidarity with Ukraine, allowing Russian players to compete in official tournaments undermines the very principles of peace, freedom, and human rights that the ICCF stands for.

The invasion of Ukraine represents a blatant violation of international law and a tragic humanitarian crisis. Furthermore, it is a genocide against the people of Ukraine and threatens the very values that the chess community should stand for. Regardless of the neutral flags under which they compete, the participation of players with ties to Russia implicitly condones the actions of the Russian government and undermines efforts to promote peace and justice.

As a fervent believer in a world where peace, freedom, and human rights are non-negotiable values, I urge the ICCF to take immediate action to suspend Russian players from official tournaments until the conflict is resolved and justice is restored. This step is essential not only to uphold the integrity of the sport but also to demonstrate solidarity with the victims of aggression and injustice.

I encourage the ICCF to reconsider its stance and demonstrate leadership by aligning its actions with the principles it claims to uphold. While I can only speak for myself, I truly believe the chess community looks to the ICCF to maintain the highest standards of ethics and morality, and I hope you will act quickly in this critical moment.

This topic touches me deeply, and I am a constant supporter. Even if my support may seem small, I firmly believe that every little bit matters in making a difference.

Thank you for considering this urgent matter.

Sincerely,

Amici Sumus (We Are Friends),
