In my post [Where have you been](https://chess.myvortexcloud.com/2024/05/02/Take-a-Break/), I talked about intense tournaments and preliminary matches and unexpectedly reaching finals. I think it's a beginner failure when you start to play correspondence chess, get excited, and see the format fits.

# Champions League 2024 C2 

### CCM Michael Dudley
Game against CCM Michael Dudley, whom I met multiple times. A game without drama, where my goal was just "don't lose". So, the calm game and draw was what I was going for against such stromg player, who has beaten me multiple times.

### CCM Paulo Adriano Matozo

I found this one a bit frustrating, because I had the feeling I could turn it into a win, but I was not able to. My position as Black was not bad at all. Check it out. Love to hear your thoughts on this one.

### CCM Amayak Martunikovich Babasyan

Russian player, I offered every 10th move a draw until he accepted.

# ICCF Veterans World Cup 13 Semi-Final 9

There are 10 semi-final groups, and the winner of each semi-final group and any tied players after tie breaks are applied will qualify to play in the final. 

Rank 14 of 15 and two games to go. Some great learnings. I might win the last two games. This might push me to the middle field with 6.5 points.
