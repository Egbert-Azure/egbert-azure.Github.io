In my post [Where have you been](https://chess.myvortexcloud.com/2024/05/02/Take-a-Break/) I talked about intense tournaments and preliminary matches and reaching unexpectedly finals. I think it's a beginner failure when you start to play correspondence chess, get excited and see the format fits

# ICCF Veterans World Cup 13 Semi-Final 9

There are 10 semi-final groups, and the winner of each semi-final group and any tied players after tie breaks are applied will qualify to play in the final. 

Rank 14 of 15 and two games to go. Some great learnings. I might win the last two games. This might push me to the middle field with 6.5 points.
