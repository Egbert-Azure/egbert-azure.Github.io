Chesspunks, it's been a while since my last post, but fear not—I've been deep in the game. Following a flurry of intense tournaments and preliminary matches, I decided to hit the brakes and reflect on my chess journey. I needed to reassess my approach and set clearer goals for myself.

Having unexpectedly advanced to some finals, I realized I had spread myself too thin by signing up for numerous tournaments. After careful consideration, I've narrowed my focus to two key events that hold the most significance for me:

- Electronic Knights
- Champions League

As for the Veterans Worldcup, I'm still deliberating its place in my schedule.

I've also made the decision to conclude my participation in the US Friendly tournament after my match against the Netherlands. My message is clear: it's time to hone in and prioritize. I'll be honest—exhaustion got the better of me, and I found myself making only a handful of moves in ongoing tournaments.

Which is a big advantage if you play correspondence chess.

So, this blog will be crisp and short, and I will share some more games next week.

I finished the last game - finally - in the Electronic Knights 2021 Semi-Final 21ENs04. I reached the Semi-Finals in two groups and was able to reach the final in the 21ENs03 group. In the final I had a first draw and a first win. More about this next week.

Even if 21ENs04, the last game has no relevance, I wanted to finish "in style". At a certain point, my opponent offered me a draw, but I declined knowing I had a chance to win. A game for the statistics and improving the rating, but an exciting one. Check it out.
