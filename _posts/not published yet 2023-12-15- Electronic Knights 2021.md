In the realm of correspondence chess, the Electronic Knights Tournament by the US Chess Federation (USCF) stands as a well known and highly ranked tournament, hosting a unique blend of tradition and very experienced players. 

Comprising three intense rounds—Preliminaries, Semi-finals, and Finals—the tournament brings together seven players in each round, each assigned six games alternating between White and Black. The rulebook dictates that only those who amass four and a half (4½) or more points in a section will progress to the next round. However, in the absence of such high scorers, those with a commendable four (4) points secure a ticket to the subsequent stage.

The Semi-final and Final rounds, shrouded in anticipation, remain unpaired until the completion of the preceding round, heightening the suspense for both participants and spectators alike. The selection of players for these crucial rounds is a meticulous process, involving sorting based on points scored in the previous round, player ratings, and section considerations.

As the dust settles and the qualified players emerge, a unique sorting algorithm comes into play. In the event that the number of qualified players doesn't align with a multiple of 7, a fascinating twist unfolds. Players who scored four (4) or fewer points in the previous round, yet remain unqualified, are strategically added to the bottom of the list, ensuring a seamless transition to the next multiple of 7.

This blog will take you deep into the heart of the Semi-finals, specifically in Group USCF 21ENs03, where I navigated through the challenges and clinched 5 points. The tantalizing prospect of the Finals beckons, fueled by the outcome of a lingering game in Group USCF 21ENs04, where victory could propel me further. Join me as we dissect three pivotal games, exploring the nuances, triumphs, and strategic intricacies that define the Electronic Knights Tournament.

In this dynamic arena where every move counts, the journey is far from linear. As we unravel the layers of the tournament structure, the quest for victory unfolds against the backdrop of the ever-evolving digital chessboard. The Electronic Knights Tournament 2021 is not just a competition; it's a saga of skill, strategy, and the relentless pursuit of excellence in the realm where tradition meets technology.
