## Introduction

Here we are, this is blog post number 40! Thank you all for your comments on LinkedIn regarding my last post, especially to [Daniel Furfaro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dansbrandmoves/). Daniel, one of my keen observers, shared his thoughts on the match:

*Daniel wrote the following thoughtful comment on LinkedIn:*

<div style="border: 1px solid white; padding: 10px">
     <blockquote style="font-size: 20px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400;">
"You both played a level of chess that puts me to shame. It looked close and then all of a sudden there were no pawns in front of your king. Re: nuances. There’s something there. Something about that principle that applies beyond chess. Small mistakes … or rather the small decisions we make every day — they add up to significant consequences beyond what we may foresee. I love the dual respect for each other as chess players as well as the fierce competition that still takes place in-play. All the best to Paolo and wishing you the best on your next tournament as well."

His words resonated deeply with me. Reflecting on the game, I responded to him on LinkedIn, appreciating his insights and sharing my own thoughts on the match:

<div style="border: 1px solid white; padding: 10px">
     <blockquote style="font-size: 20px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400;">

"Daniel, well said! I like your thoughts! When I moved off the beaten path, I thought I could at least draw, and at some point, I even thought I could win. The way you play typically in correspondence is to create a complex situation (which we did). Engines don't help you much here ;-) I should have been warned, his pawn structure was very active, and as you rightfully said, out of a sudden my king was looking around 'Where have my pawns gone?' Lol. Thanks a lot for reading and your comment here!"

The essence of chess, much like life, lies in the nuances and small decisions we make. Daniel's observation about small mistakes leading to significant consequences extends beyond the chessboard, reminding us of the impact of our everyday choices. His appreciation for the respect and fierce competition between players adds a layer of depth to the game, highlighting the beauty of sportsmanship and strategic thinking.
Secondly, I believe if you stay in beaten path you need to know we all read probably the same tactics books. The players know how to defend themselves against the other’s tactics. So, what you need to win and to improve is simple: understand chess and build your own strategy. Sometimes it paid out and sometimes not - nuances matter!

How can this be a better start for blog number 40?

Shortly after publishing blog 39, I finished my last game in the Semi-Finals of Veterans Worldcup 13. It was against Correspondence Chess Master [Detlef Zoll](https://www.iccf.com/player?id=82490). Detlef is a very experienced player from Germany, and it has always been a highlight for me to meet a fellow German player over the virtual board.

Detlef, 69, lives near Berlin and has had a rich career as a veterinarian and later in medical technology. His warm introduction set a friendly tone for our match, and we exchanged well wishes for Christmas and the New Year.

We had a pleasant conversation during our game, wishing each other the best for the holidays. At move 29, Detlef offered a draw, but I declined because I felt I had the advantage and was on the path to victory.

## Highlight Game Against Detlef Zoll - Last Game in VWC 13 Semi-Finals

I didn't take many notes during the game. It was a busy tournament phase (if this counts as an excuse).

It's not the my most spectacular game, but this relates to earlier quotes and findings - nuances matter! Three inaccurate moves have been enough for Black to lose the game.
