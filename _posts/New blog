# Victor Palciauskas Tournament

Today's blog I'm referring again to USCF correspondence news. The third game in a row I was mentioned. The game comes from Victor Palciauskas section 21VP04 where I won the section with an undefeated 6-0 score. Here is my favorite game from that event, this one against Matt LaDuke. White starts a clever expansion in the center with 10. c5 to push Black’s King Knight back. Then he sacs a pawn with 13. e6. Then he pitches in a knight for two pawns with the promise of a third pawn or a strong attack. Black tries to give back an Exchange to blunt White’s attack. I tried to create an imbalance taking the Rook and three pawns versus Bishop + Knight advantage and grinds it down to a winning endgame with two connected passed pawns.
