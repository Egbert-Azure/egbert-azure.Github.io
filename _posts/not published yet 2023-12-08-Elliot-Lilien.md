This week, I uncovered some vintage 'Golden Knights' tournament games and stumbled upon one played by Elliot Lilien, which I took the liberty to analyze.

Regrettably, my quest to learn more about the player took a somber turn when I discovered that Elliot Lilien had passed away on June 13, 2023. He was not just a chess enthusiast but a prolific correspondence chess player, actively participating in Golden Knights preliminary and semi-final sections, as well as engaging in two-player matches since 2004¹.

In honor of this remarkable individual, I have decided to publish one of his games, even though it ended in a loss for Elliot.

Beyond the chessboard, Elliot Lilien was a beloved Social Studies teacher at Concord-Carlisle High School for over 35 years, spanning from 1965 to 2000². His impact extended beyond the classroom, as he served as the head coach of the fencing team, guiding them to over 120 consecutive victories against high school and college teams along the East Coast². Additionally, he led the CCHS tennis team to state championships and formed the Academic Bowl team, leading them to state championships as well².

***Analysis:** The game took a decisive turn in favor of Black after the opening. White struggled to recover, leading to a loss. The weighted error values suggest opportunities for improvement in the game.*

**In Memory**

Elliot Lilien's contributions to chess and education are truly commendable. His legacy goes beyond the chessboard, leaving an indelible mark on students and colleagues alike.
