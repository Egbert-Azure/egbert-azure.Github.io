Jörn Gehring - the developer of Chessconnect - had a dream.

He wanted an easy way to connect his ChessNut chessboard with Lichess without connection dropped.
So, why not write a browser plug in? And he did. And he expanded the functions, going above and beyond to add some great functions.

What is Chessconnect?

As the name said, it connects smart chessboards of various brands to either chess.com or lichess.org.

Chessconnect is a Chrome web extension that allows owners of smart chessboards to connect their boards to either chess.com or lichess.org. 
And it works great with Microsoft Edge too.

The main features are:

- works in browser and therfore has no dependencies to OS
- integrates seamlessly into chess.com and lichess.org
- supports chess boards from many different manufacturers
- both USB and Bluetooth connections
- less trouble with cheat detection
- games against bots, human opponents, and live tournaments
- optional delay to reduce risk of mouse/board slips
- optional sound or move announcement as speech
- move and time display on DGT3000 chess clock
- non-commercial and free to use

And bottom line, it does what I wish the Chessnut app would do, providing latency options and simplify the access with no dependency which device I use.

Chessnut Air and Pro both have an internal battery and report their charging state to Chessconnect. Hence, the „Connect“-Button turns red when the remaining charge is less then 33%.

Chessconnect allows the board to be rotated by 180°. Meaning you can put the black pieces on ranks 1 and two and the white pieces on ranks 7 and 8. This is especially useful for the Chessnut Pro which has no visible coordinates.
