Hello chess enthusiasts,

I thought it was time for another blog post to share some games and learnings with you, and to update you on my progress. Officially, I have set my goal as the "Road to 2200," which will be challenging given that I am now paired against stronger players than in the past.

That said, as of last official calculation I reached ELO 2165 for the period 2024/3-7/1/2024.

# Champions League

Here are the recent games I finished in the Champions League:

1. CL/2024/C2 Albano Rivares, Fernando - loss
2. CL/2024/C2 Underwood, Wesley K. - draw
3. CL/2024/C2 Pierron, Pascal - draw

Despite a system slip that resulted in an unfortunate resignation after move 2, the tournament is going better than expected. However, I have not secured a win so far. Let's start with a detailed look at another loss.

## Game Analysis: Fernando Albano Rivares

After the system slip, I was distracted and not focused on my game with Fernando Albano Rivares, a true gentleman and wonderful person to play and chat with. I played a line I have played a gazillion times, but due to distraction, I blundered on my 10th move. Instead of castling, I took exd4. Oh boy, I immediately knew that was it. Additionally, I made two more inaccurate moves and could not survive against two strong bishops.

This game clearly shows that in chess, you need to stay focused. A momentary lapse in concentration can lead to a critical mistake, as seen in my 10th move. Always keep your head in the game!
