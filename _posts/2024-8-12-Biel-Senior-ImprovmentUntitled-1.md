## Introduction

The journey of a senior chess improver is often filled with challenges, but it's also marked by moments of triumph that inspire others on the same path. Many of my blogs reflect on my journey and how I’ve improved and reached my current level in chess. In this post, I want to highlight the achievements of Daniel Bachmann, a dedicated follower of my blog who recently made waves at the Biel International Chess Festival.

Daniel Bachmann is a Swiss chess player with a FIDE rating 1742 in standard chess. Although he doesn’t hold any official FIDE titles, he is actively competing, with a rapid rating of 1798 and a blitz rating of 1704. His connection to chess is deeply personal. In a recent LinkedIn post, Daniel shared how he was inspired to work at IBM after witnessing Deep Blue’s victory over the world chess champion in 1997. His early passion for chess was ignited by his late brother

Over the last couple of years, Daniel and I have exchanged numerous ideas about integrating technology into our chess training. Our discussions have ranged from using ChessBase 17 with the Chessnut Air eboard to exploring the potential of ChessConnect. Daniel mentioned that he primarily uses ChessBase with Graham’s driver to connect his Chessnut Air eboard, allowing him to play on platforms like Chess.com against bots while refining his openings, which he trains on Chessable. Although he doesn’t play on Chess.com himself...
We also discussed the value of correspondence chess, where Daniel shared that he utilizes the database to enhance his Nimzo and Semi-Tarrasch repertoire. Correspondence chess, as he put it, is a goldmine for discovering new ideas and novelties. Recently, he’s been using the Chessnut Evo to prepare for over-the-board games alongside ChessBase 17, ChessBook, and Chessable. His focus has been mastering a 20,000-move repertoire, covering even the most obscure sidelines despite the challenge of memorizing them.

## The Game

One of Daniel's most remarkable games from the Biel tournament showcases the depth of his preparation and strategic insight. He made a spectacular comeback in classical chess with a 98.1% accuracy after a break spanning over two decades—a testament to his dedication and skill. Below is an interactive replay of that game, where you'll see his thought process unfold move by move.

For those who want a deeper dive into the game, Daniel has also put together a detailed analysis video. His commentary is insightful, and it’s clear that his preparation was meticulously done, likely incorporating some of the techniques we've discussed over the months.
