This week I digged out some old 'Golden Knights" tournament games and found one from Elliot Lilien I analyzed.

I tryied to look up the player and found out, Elliot Lilien passed away on June 13, 2023. He was a prolific correspondence chess player playing in numerous Golden Knights preliminary and semi-final sections and two-player matches going back to 2004.
