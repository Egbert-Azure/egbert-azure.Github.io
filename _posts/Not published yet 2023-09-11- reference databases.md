**Introduction:**
Correspondence chess is a form of chess where players exchange moves through the mail or other forms of communication, and games can take weeks, months, or even years to complete. This allows players to take their time to analyze the position and find the best move. Consulting opening and endgame materials has always been acceptable during correspondence chess. In the dynamic realm of chess, the advent of digital technology has brought forth tools that revolutionize the way players prepare, analyze, and perfect their strategies. Correspondence chess has witnessed a paradigm shift with the integration of reference databases. In this article, we explore how players can elevate their correspondence chess skills using Chessbase own Mega Database, and delve into the unique features of UltraCorr23.

You ask about engine usage? The strongest players will still navigate their usage far better than a normal player would, and none are foolish enough to simply let the engine sit on a position for a day and play the move. It is a very good way to lose I can tell you! But that's a different story to tell in another blog.

**Reference Databases in Correspondence Chess:**
Reference databases are invaluable resources that provide players with a comprehensive collection of chess games, openings, variations, and analyses. These databases serve as indispensable aids for players' preparation, opening repertoire development, and overall strategic improvement.

**1. Chessbase: An Expansive Repository of Chess Knowledge**

At the forefront of chess software is Chessbase, renowned for its versatile tools that cater to players at all levels. At its core is the Mega Database, an extensive compilation of chess games that offers an array of benefits for correspondence chess enthusiasts.

- **Mega Database**: With a vast collection of over 8 million games, the Mega Database empowers players to refine their opening repertoire and grasp essential concepts. Although not specifically tailored for correspondence chess, this database provides a wealth of historical and contemporary games that players can draw inspiration from.

**UltraCorr23: A Dedicated Correspondence Chess Hub**

UltraCorr23 is a specialized reference database exclusively tailored for correspondence chess enthusiasts. It is meticulously crafted in ChessBase format to ensure compatibility with various software versions, extending back to ChessBase 8 and other software like Fritz. The UltraCorr2023 database has over 2,452,000 games and is edited by chess historian and CC master Tim Harding. It is the most accurate correspondence chess game database ever published. 

**Content Overview:**
- **Server Games:** This database is a treasure trove for correspondence chess aficionados, encompassing recently played games from renowned servers such as ICCF, LSS, and FICGS, with updates extending to the end of 2022.

- **Historical Gems:** UltraCorr23 is committed to preserving the rich history of correspondence chess. The year 2022 witnessed an extensive effort to incorporate historical correspondence chess games from the 19th and 20th centuries. Notably, games from Professor Pagni's book collections were included, with meticulous corrections based on comprehensive research.

- **19th Century Games:** The database offers a unique window into 19th-century chess with a wealth of games from Deutsche Schachzeitung and other printed sources.

While Chessbase's Mega Database provides a plethora of games, UltraCorr23 stands as a dedicated resource that caters to the unique needs of correspondence chess enthusiasts.

Now, the crucial question is, how can you make the most of these resources? Simply relying on ChessBase's Mega Database may not suffice in today's noisy online world, where blitz and rapid games abound. Moreover, sifting through low-rated player blitz games might not be fruitful. What proves to be invaluable is the creation of a specialized subset known as the "slow games database" from the Mega Database. To further enhance its utility, consider excluding games played by players rated below 1800, or adjust this threshold according to your preferences. Then, complement this subset with UltraCorr23, eliminating potential duplicates and utilizing this refined database for your correspondence chess endeavors.

As players continue to embrace these tools, the lines between human and machine blur, forging a symbiotic relationship that enriches the world of correspondence chess. With every move made and analyzed, these reference databases solidify their position as cornerstones of chess excellence in the digital age.
