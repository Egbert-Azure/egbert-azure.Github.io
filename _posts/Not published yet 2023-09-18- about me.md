I learned chess from my dad when I was about 6 years old. It was just for fun and on a cheap board and chess pieces, part of a game collection with checkers and others. My dad passed away way to early in 1971 and would have turned 100 this year November. I'm wondering what he would think about today's chess world, that thought brings a smile on my face.

I have never played in a chess club in Germany, but I played against some members of chess clubs. Also, I never played real competitve chess. However, the Fischer boom, Helmut Pfleger and  Vlastimil Hort and their Schach der Gro√ümeister German television show influenced me. There was literaly no TV broadcast I mssed. At a time when there was no straming and no video recording, that means a lot.

Bobby Fischer was different, it was East versus West in the middle of the Cold War. The chess match between Bobby Fischer and the Russian defending champion Boris Spassky still fascinates me today, truly a "Match of the Century" which continues to have an impact to this day.

During my night shifts when I worked as a chemical technician to finance my study, I played chess with my collegues during breaks. Which was kind of competitive, because like chess hustlers today, we played for some money.

Within the family, my godfather was able to play chess. He thought he was good, I never said he was not. Every Christmas we played some games or during some visits at my grandma's house, where he lived too with his family.

My brother in law, Sleh Badoui was a fantastic chess player and we played very often. Sleh studied art and graphics at Sorbonne in Paris, lived in the Netherlands, but born in Tunis.

I embarked on an chess comeback in 2020 after a 25-year + hiatus from the game. Despite the long break, my passion for chess was rekindled, and I quickly immersed myself in the world of chess, determined to make my mark once again.

Since my return, I've achieved significant milestones in correspondence chess. My imminent second norm in correspondence chess with the ICCF underscores my ability to strategize and execute plans meticulously over extended periods.

Breaking through the 2000 Elo rating in USCF within a short time frame is a testament to my innate chess skills and my relentless pursuit of improvement. Notably, my participation in the Electronic Knights 2021 semi-finals showcases my adaptability to the modern chess landscape and my competitive spirit.

Even as a chess veteran who returned to the game after a quarter-century break, I fearlessly ventured into the ICCF Veterans World Cup semi-finals, demonstrating that age is no barrier to achieving success in this intellectually stimulating pursuit.

My journey is a testament to the enduring allure of chess and the limitless potential for self-improvement at any age. I remain deeply committed to chess, continuously honing my skills, and embracing the challenges that this timeless game offers.

And October 2023 marked the next milestone and achievment: I was ranked nr. 90 in the top 100 US correspondence chessplayers.
