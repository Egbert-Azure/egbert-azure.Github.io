I embarked on an extraordinary chess comeback in 2020 after a remarkable 25-year hiatus from the game. Despite the long break, my passion for chess was rekindled, and I quickly immersed myself in the world of chess, determined to make my mark once again.

Since my return, I've achieved significant milestones in correspondence chess. My imminent second norm in correspondence chess with the ICCF underscores my ability to strategize and execute plans meticulously over extended periods.

Breaking through the 2000 Elo rating in USCF within a short time frame is a testament to my innate chess skills and my relentless pursuit of improvement. Notably, my participation in the Electronic Knights 2021 semi-finals showcases my adaptability to the modern chess landscape and my competitive spirit.

Even as a chess veteran who returned to the game after a quarter-century break, I fearlessly ventured into the ICCF Veterans World Cup semi-finals, demonstrating that age is no barrier to achieving success in this intellectually stimulating pursuit.

My journey is a testament to the enduring allure of chess and the limitless potential for self-improvement at any age. I remain deeply committed to chess, continuously honing my skills, and embracing the challenges that this timeless game offers.
