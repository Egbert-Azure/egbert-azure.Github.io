sight, although some players make use of them as if they 
conferred sight. José Raul Capablanca

In this blog I like to share at first a game from USCF Around the World friendly tournament. Funny enough, I played against Germany.

Thomas played 7 unbelievable strong moves and I had some sweat on my forehead.

But first things first. What is the USC friendly?

Friendly Matches are team versus team chess contests
(involving teams affiliated with different nations) where the overall team outcomes do not 
matter beyond bragging rights. Everyone is eligible to play. The ICCF-US uses both a standing
set of interested players and new participants in virtually every match. Each match participant 
plays two rated games, one with white and one with black, against a single opponent of nearly 
identical rating. Dennis Doren is ICCF-US Friendly Match Organizer. No engines are allowed.

My opponent, who was nominated to play on three boards by the German team (which is a testament for his strength) played the Trompowsky Attack. 1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 White prepares to exchange the bishop for Black's knight, inflicting doubled pawns upon Black in the process.

The second game was played with the Dutch Defense, which is an aggressive and ambitious opening that vies for control of the e4 square. I was surprised because usually it's played against 1.d4. The Leningrad Variation is characterized by the fianchetto of the dark-squared bishop. The mainline starts with the moves 1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nf3 g6 4. g3 Bg7 5. Bg2 d6 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3. However, as we can see due his moves the position transposed to the Leningrad variation. A GM level might have different thoughts here.

Switzerland maintains its 3-point lead with 13 remaining games. There is still time to catch up and go ahead! Best of luck USA!

Peru

In this game the Closed Sicilian was played, A chess opening that arises after the moves 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3. It is a variation of the Sicilian Defense in which white doesn’t open the center with an early d2-d4. Instead, white often fianchettos the light bishop and plans to slowly build up on the kingside 1. The move g3 is not played in this variation.

I rarely play c5, but I think it caught my oponent a bit off guard. The final nail in the coffin was his tactical blunder with move 31.
