# Introduction

Before we start kind of a fun story and memory when I wrote [week 23 puzzle](https://chess.myvortexcloud.com/puzzles/2024-Week-23/) with a game of Rainer Schlenker. It's worth to remember this great player, who lives now in daycare.
The knight on the rim has a notoriously bad reputation with the saying "A knight on the rim is grim." On the other hand, edge knights have decided World Championship matches, such as Bobby Fischer's surprising Nf6-h5 in the "Match of the Century" against Boris Spassky in 1972. Magnus Carlsen also occasionally employs the "edge knight system" 1.e4 g6 2.d4 Nf6 3.e5 Nh5.

In German language it's *Randspringer* and *Randspringer* and that wa exactly the self published Magazine of Rainer Schlenker.
