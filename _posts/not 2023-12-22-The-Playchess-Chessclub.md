## The Chess Odyssey Begins

While not a big fan of online blitz or rapid games, I found solace and challenge in platforms that valued strategy and growth over quick victories. It's also a good way to test your opening knowledge, pattern recognition and intuition under time pressure.
Lichess was one, but the true gem turned out to be Playchess. Apologies to the chess.com enthusiasts, but Playchess had me hooked from the start.

Let's summarize a bit before we go into Playchess details.

ChessBase offers a variety of web tools and an online chess platform that are quite innovative:

**Web Tools:**
ChessBase provides several free tools that can be embedded on websites to enhance the user's chess experience. These tools include interactive diagrams, live tournament tracking, and tactics training. They also offer a cloud database tool that allows users to access their databases directly in a browser. Users can edit, add, remove, and create databases for use in ChessBase.
In order to use the Web Apps it is absolutely necessary to have a ChessBase Acount. So every user who would like to make use of the web apps service must set up a ChessBase Account.

**Online Chess Platform:**
ChessBase's online chess platform, play.chessbase.com, allows users to play rated games against opponents of similar strength. The platform offers games with various time controls, from bullet to slow games⁶. Users can also participate in regular tournaments with Ducats prizes⁶. The platform includes a feature to play against Fritz, a chess program that plays like a human and makes subtle tactical mistakes. Users can also follow live master games from top tournaments.
Games are automatically synchronised in your Chessbase or Fritz program.

In summary, ChessBase's web tools and online chess platform provide a comprehensive and innovative suite of tools for chess enthusiasts of all levels. These tools enhance the user's ability to play, learn, and enjoy the game of chess.


## Playchess: Beyond the Chessboard

Not just a platform for playing games, Playchess proved to be a rich and multifaceted online server. It offered more than just the thrill of moving pieces on a digital board. Live lectures, simultaneous exhibitions, private lessons, and even the ability to set up a private chess club page with special events – Playchess was a chess aficionado's dream come true.

While enjoying live commentary and testing my skills with the tactics trainer, I felt a craving to go beyond being a mere spectator. This desire led me to explore the possibility of creating my own chess club on Playchess, a space where chess enthusiasts could come together, learn, and engage.

## Crafting the Virtual Haven

Creating a chess club on Playchess is surprisingly easy. The platform offers the flexibility to open your own club room, play with club members, and even share a link to the club room on external websites. And the best part? It costs nothing!

So, what I have done for your all convinience, I created a **Senior Chess Improver**

 Every club, school or trainer can open a virtual playing room on the ChessBase server. Everything is possible: casual games, tournaments, online training, simultaneous events, etc. Everything on "your" chess server! The best alternative to keep the club evening running, and a good (virtual) meeting point to play chess together. Creating a virtual club room is easy.

 Video and Audio during a 1:1 game or tournament? Not a problem at all.

## Sharpening Skills with Playchess Tactics Training

As the chess pieces moved across the digital board, I delved into the world of Playchess Tactics Training. The Chessbase Endgame Studies site became my haven for honing skills, appreciating the beauty of chess moves, and experiencing the brilliance of the game.
