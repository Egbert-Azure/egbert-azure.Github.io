Welcome back, fellow chess enthusiasts! It's been an eventful year in chess, and I'm excited to share my latest chess adventures with you. In this blog post, we'll dive into my recent performance in the 2021 Electronic Knights Championship Semi-Final Section (21ENs03), where I secured 5 wins and 1 loss. But that's not all; I also have some exciting news about my current ranking in the US Correspondence Chess scene.

And another exciting message from USCF tournament director:

What a message, with age 66 next year, I will play the top US correspondence chess players in the finals in 2024!

So, grab your favorite chess set, and let's explore this week annotated game together!

**A Game with a familiar adversary: Herb Wolfe**

My last game in the 21ENs03 section pitted me against a familiar opponent, Herb Wolfe. The game was finished today. Herb and I have crossed swords multiple times on the virtual battlefield, and this game was no exception. It was a challenging match that kept me in my seat. I'll share the game with you shortly, but first, let's talk about what led up to this showdown.

The path to the Electronic Knights Championship semi-final section was filled with intense matches, but my determination to improve and grow as a chess player remained unwavering. I approached each game to learn from my opponents and refine my skills. The dedication and effort paid off, as I secured five victories and one draw loss, securing my first place to join the semi-finals with a Prelim Score of 5.5.

**Annotated game with Herb Wolfe:**

In the Electronic Knights Semi-Final, section 21ENs03 I was again paired with Herb Wolfe, whom I had the plessure to play multiple times.

With Black I decided to go with the Pirc after he opened with e4. It ends up in a B08 Pirc Classical System and after move 10 I was behind my development, but managed to come back, having a perfect middle game.
His Bh6 and Q protecting made me nervous. I typicall don't trade that early Q, but with move 16 they have been off the board. Pushing Harry the h pawn gave me good structure on the King side. And gaining space pushing the Aaron the a pawn on Q side. 

Harry the h pawn encouraged Frederik the f pawn and George the g pawn to move forward and block the entire K side.

I guess it became a pawn nightmare for my opponent.
