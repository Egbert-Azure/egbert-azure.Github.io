## How to Create Your Own Chess Club

Playchess.com is a platform where you can play chess, train, and organize tournaments. It allows you to open your own club room and play with your club members. The platform is interactive and offers a variety of features to enhance your chess playing experience. You can also add a link to the club room on playchess.com onto your website, essentially creating your own server. 


Creating the virtual rooms costs nothing!

Players need a ChessBase Account. You can enter the room as guest but then you cannot chat and no one will recognize you because you only have a number which, moreover, changes at each visit.

With a new ChessBase STARTER Account you can test the program for 90 days for free. And a Premium Account allows you to use all WebApps in the ChessBase Account, including thousands of training videos: account.chessbase.com

Go to play.chessbase.com/en/CreateAccount to create an account.
