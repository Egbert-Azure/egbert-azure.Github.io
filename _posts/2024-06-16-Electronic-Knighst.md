# Introduction

Before sharing the latest updates on my progress in the Electronic Knights tournament, I want to share a fun story and a cherished memory involving the legendary chess player Rainer Schlenker. This memory is connected to the [Week 23 puzzle](https://chess.myvortexcloud.com/puzzles/2024-Week-23/) which featured one of his games.

Rainer Schlenker, a German International Master (IM), has made significant contributions to the chess world through his exceptional play and dedication to the game. Over the years, he has competed in numerous national and international tournaments, showcasing his strategic prowess. Beyond his playing career, Schlenker has also been an advocate for chess, engaging in both promotion and teaching.

The term "knight on the rim" is a nod to the adage "A knight on the rim is grim," yet history has shown that these edge knights can be game-changers. Notable examples include Bobby Fischer's surprising Nf6-h5 move in his 1972 World Championship match against Boris Spassky and Magnus Carlsen's occasional use of the "edge knight system" with moves like 1.e4 g6 2.d4 Nf6 3.e5 Nh5.

In German, a knight on the rim translates to *Randspringer*, which was also the title of Raomer Schlenker's self-published magazine.

Back in the day, publishing a magazine involved a typewriter and a lot of passion—a true testament to Schlenker's love for the game.

Today, technology makes it easier to share our love for chess through platforms like this blog. While it still requires effort, the process is much more accessible. Now, let's get into the updates on my latest results in the Electronic Knights tournament.

# Electronic Knights - Finals

## Section 21ENf01

First of all this shows how it goes with correspondence chess. The tournament started 2021 and we are now - 4 years later - in the finals. That set things in perspective. I have to say it was a great decission by USCF to move to ICCF server witht this engine free format. It makes things much easier than with email. The start date was 1/19/2024, the end date is 7/19/2026.

As of May 2024 top 100 player list I'm ranked as [nr. 73 Schroeer](https://www.uschess.org/component/option,com_top_players/Itemid,371?op=list&month=2405&f=usa&l=C:Top%20Correspondence%20Ratings.&h=Correspondence%20Players), Egbert Heinrich (30088451) with ELO 2099.

All details about ratings with calculation examples [are here](https://new.uschess.org/correspondence-chess/ratings) for those who like to find out more.

And now I finished the first two games. Enjoy!

## Game Analysis: Nohr, Matthew

I don't remember exactly, but I think this is my fourth game against Mathew, whom I met first to discuss how to implement chess engine compute cluster with ChessBase, but that's a different story.
Have a look to the annotated game. You find my thoughts during the game also added in annotations.

## Game Analysis: Barclay, Dean

I never played Dean and it was an interesting experience. Under correspondence thought this was more like "correspondence blitz".
My pawn majority at the end didn't brought me over a winning finish line and I offered a draw when a threeefold repetition by White would have been very likely.

My thoughtsd during the game are in the annotations too.

I believe worth to look into it again, especially tha calculated sidelines during the game.
